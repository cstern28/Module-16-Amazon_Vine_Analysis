# Module-16-Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine Program. The program allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and prodive products to Amazon Vine memebers who are required to publish a review. Through PySpark and ETL process, I did an analysis of Pet product reviews on Amazon.

## Results
### The Results presented in a Table

- The table above shows that there were 170 reviews from Vine Program and 37,840 reviews not from the Vine Program. 
- This means that way more customers are willing to write reviews on pet products no matter whether in the Vine Program. 
- The Vine program gave 65 5 star reviews, whereas the non-vine program gave 20,612 reviews with 5 stars. 
- The Vine program had 38% 5 star reviews, whereas the non-Vine program had 54% of total reviews were 5 stars. 

## Summary
### Conclusion
Based on the results, there is less a posibility for bias reviews because more customers in this practicular item for pet products rated positive, 5 stars reviews than Vine members by 16%. This means that many customers gave 5 start reviews even if they weren't in the Vine program and had to write a review. However, there is not enough data anlyzed to draw a complete conclusion. I would need to analyse more product item reviews to determine if there is a consistent trend or pattern. I would do the same analysis for at least 10% of data set populations available of product reviews to draw a better, more reliable conclusion.
